**API Request with Requests Library**
=====================================

Below is a Python implementation using the Requests library to send a GET request to a specified API endpoint.

```python
import requests
import json

def send_api_request(url: str, method: str = 'GET', params: dict = None, headers: dict = None, data: dict = None):
    """
    Sends an API request to the specified endpoint.

    Args:
    - url (str): The URL of the API endpoint.
    - method (str): The HTTP method to use (default is 'GET').
    - params (dict): A dictionary of query parameters (default is None).
    - headers (dict): A dictionary of HTTP headers (default is None).
    - data (dict): A dictionary of data to be sent in the request body (default is None).

    Returns:
    - response (requests.Response): The response object from the API request.
    """

    # Create a dictionary to store the request parameters
    request_params = {
        'method': method,
        'url': url,
        'params': params,
        'headers': headers,
        'json': data
    }

    try:
        # Send the API request
        response = requests.request(**request_params)

        # Check if the request was successful
        response.raise_for_status()

        return response

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        # Handle any exceptions that occur during the request
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'
    response = send_api_request(url)

    if response:
        # Print the response text
        print(response.text)

        # Parse the response as JSON
        json_data = response.json()
        print(json.dumps(json_data, indent=4))
```

**Best Practices:**

1. **Use Meaningful Variable Names:** The code uses meaningful variable names like `url`, `method`, `params`, `headers`, and `data` to improve readability.
2. **Handle Exceptions:** The code includes exception handling to catch any errors that might occur during the API request.
3. **Type Hints:** The function parameters and return types are annotated with type hints to improve code readability and facilitate type checking.
4. **Example Usage:** The code includes an example usage section to demonstrate how to use the `send_api_request` function.

**Security Considerations:**

1. **Validate User Input:** Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
2. **Use HTTPS:** Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to encrypt the communication between the client and server and protect sensitive data.
3. **Handle Sensitive Data:** Handle sensitive data like API keys, authentication tokens, or user credentials securely and never hardcode them in the code.
