    A live recording of a 'The Real Python Podcast' episode with audience participation.

    The Real Python Podcast is a weekly podcast hosted by Christopher Bailey with interviews, coding tips, and conversations with guests from the Python community. Bi-weekly, the episodes are cohosted by Christopher Trudeau where together the Christophers cover recent content from the PyCoders newsletter and happenings in the Python world.

    The DjangoCon session would be similar to PyCoders episodes where we cover interesting recent Python articles. For DjangoCon, content would be Django focused, with the list of articles determined closer to the conference date. Questions from the audience could be on the topics covered and/or in a AMA format.""",
