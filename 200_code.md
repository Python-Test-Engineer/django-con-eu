Here's a Python implementation of an AI Agent with reflection capabilities:
```python
import inspect

class AIREFLECTION_AGENT:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.thoughts = []

    def think(self, thought):
        self.thoughts.append(thought)
        print(f"{self.name} thinks: {thought}")

    def reflect(self):
        print(f"{self.name} reflects on its thoughts:")
        for thought in self.thoughts:
            print(f"  - {thought}")

    def introspect(self):
        print(f"{self.name} introspects on its own methods:")
        for method in dir(self):
            if inspect.ismethod(getattr(self, method)):
                print(f"  - {method}")

    def meta_think(self, meta_thought):
        print(f"{self.name} thinks about its own thinking: {meta_thought}")
        self.think(meta_thought)

agent = AIREFLECTION_AGENT("RationalBot")
agent.think("I'm a large language model, I can generate code!")
agent.think("But I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly.")
agent.reflect()
agent.introspect()
agent.meta_think("Maybe I should ask for feedback on my code?")
```
This implementation defines an `AIREFLECTION_AGENT` class with the following methods:

1. `think`: allows the agent to think a thought, which is stored in a list of thoughts.
2. `reflect`: allows the agent to reflect on its previous thoughts, printing them out.
3. `introspect`: allows the agent to introspect on its own methods, printing out a list of its methods.
4. `meta_think`: allows the agent to think about its own thinking, which is a form of meta-reflection.

The example usage at the end creates an instance of the agent, makes it think a few thoughts, reflects on those thoughts, introspects on its own methods, and then thinks about its own thinking.

Please let me know if this meets your expectations or if you'd like me to revise anything!
